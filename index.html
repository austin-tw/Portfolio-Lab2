            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi there! I am Austin Lin. I am from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei">Taipei</a>, Taiwan </p>It's my first time living in Canada. I have also lived Shanghai, China, as well as Louisiana and Boston in the US. I don't really like  cold winters, but it's exciting for me to see snow in Calgary, because Taiwan is a sub-tropical island that never snows. Here are some things that I like:

            <p>Personality wise, I consider myself an <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ambivert">ambivert</a> leaning slightly toward the extrovert side. I enjoy talking with others and making new friends, but I can not do it for the entire day and need some time for myself just to relax and recharge.</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>In my leisure time, I enjoy playing computer games, meditation, running, and exploring different corners of the city.</p>


            <h3>Meditation</h3>
            <p>Meditation is the art of doing nothing. I find it to have tremendous benefits for my mental and physical health. So I try to do it 20 minutes a day.</p>

            <h3>City Exploration by Walking</h3>
            <p>I really enjoy exploring different corners of the city by walking. It's a great way to combine mini-adventures with physical exercise. You never know what's around the next corner, it could be your new favorite new restaurant or a random encounter with a huge rabbit in the park.</p>
